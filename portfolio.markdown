<td style="text-align: center;">A University project where we made a game over the course of a trimester in a team of three.

<td style="text-align: center;"> Our entry for the UQAC WonderJam in the Fall of 2024. It is a survival platform game for two players. Ghosts appear from dark areas so each player tries to illuminate their part of the screen and avoid the ghosts.</td>

<td style="text-align: center;">A work in progress personal project with my friend <a href="https://github.com/LeClaptain">Ghali Mechkour</a>. The game is similar to Wii Tanks, with the player trying to destroy all enemy tanks on screen. Before starting a level, the player can choose a few power-ups.</td>

<td style="text-align: center;">A university project focused on getting familiar with AGILE project management / the SCRUM method. We had to develop an app to find recipes using what was left over in the fridge in Java. We worked as a team of six, with regular sprint planning meetings, and sprint retrospectives.</td>
